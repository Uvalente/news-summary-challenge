It is now simple fact that Scotland cannot keep the pound if we leave the UK. Alex Salmond has a responsibility to tell us what will replace the pound. Will we set up a separate unproven currency or will we be rushing to join the euro?</p> <p>Alex Salmond was arguing against about a problem of his own making - the problem of transaction costs for business due to changing currency. Avoiding extra costs to business and not placing jobs at risk are powerful reasons why we should vote to remain in the UK and keep the pound.</p> <p>Leaving the UK and losing the pound will cost jobs, raise mortgage rates, increase credit card prices and make people’s weekly shop more expensive.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-428f47c4-4d0e-47cf-a213-eafa603eb55f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/17/1392643317217/1aed0a9a-5877-47bf-87f5-5ba833eedb78-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alistair Darling\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair Darling.
